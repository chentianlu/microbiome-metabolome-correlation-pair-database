There is increased appreciation for the diverse roles of the microbiome-gut-brain axis on mammalian growth and health throughout the lifespan. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the gut microbiome and their metabolites are extensively involved in the communication between brain and gut. Association study of brain metabolome and gut microbiome is an active field offering large amounts of information on the interaction of microbiome, brain and gut. A Pairwise Spearman correlation analysis was conducted on 178 bacteria (144 genera and 34 species from the intestine of 42 Wistar rats) and 354 metabolites (derived from the brain of same rats). A total of 8131 out of the over 630 hundreds pairs (13%) were significant, after FDR correction. Among these pairs, 5039 (62%) were positive and 3092 (38%) were negatively correlated. All the pairs with their r, p, and FDR values are involved in this database.
